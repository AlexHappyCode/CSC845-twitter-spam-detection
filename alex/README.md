# Hi, This is Alex's random forest model
#### This model classifies tweets as spam or ham

# Setting Up The Notebook

The notebook that we want to run to showcase the algorithm is
random\_forest.ipynb. To do this we have to have the following packages installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- functools
- matplotlib
- import nltk

# Running the Notebook

Once the packages are installed, simply run all cells and scroll
down to see the results and the number of mismatches displayed
in the pie chart.
